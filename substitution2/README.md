# substitution2

Challenge from picoCTF 2022.

## Challenge description

It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?
Download the message [[here]](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/108/message.txt).

## Explained

Download the message using ```wget```. Show message using ```cat message.txt```. It's similar to the substitution0 / substitution1 but there are not spaces between words. Let's use [[quipqiup.com]](https://quipqiup.com) again. Make space before fstwTXA and in Clues write ```fstwTXA=picoCTF```. Next to solve set arrow and select solve(statistics). First result will be your flag.
