## Challenge description

Can you get the flag? Reverse engineer this [Java program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/144/KeygenMe.class).

Download file using ```wget```. Hint advice us to use a decompiler for Java. Use [Java decompiler online](http://www.javadecompilers.com/). Save code inside new file in your working directory.
