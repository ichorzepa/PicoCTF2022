## Challenge description

Download the disk image and use ```mmls``` on it to find the size of the Linux partition. Connect to the remote checker service to check your answer and get the flag.
Note: if you are using the webshell, download and extract the disk image into ```/tmp``` not your home directory.
[[Download disk image]](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/114/disk.img.gz)
Access checker program: ```nc saturn.picoctf.net 52279```

## Explained

Download disk image using ```wget``` (it has 28.34MB). Extract the file using ```gzip -dk disk.img.gz```. Run ```mmls disk.img```. Now run ```nc saturn.picoctf.net 52279```.
